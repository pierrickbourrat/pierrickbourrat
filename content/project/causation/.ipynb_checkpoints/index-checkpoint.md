Causation is at the heart of any scientific inquiry. I am interested in characterising this phenomenon both generally and more particularly in biological contexts. In particular, I have been interested in the concept of heritability, which is used in several subfields of biology. I have also developed several information theoretic measures of causation within the interventionist account and, more recently, proposed some ways to link information theory and the interventionist account to heritability.
