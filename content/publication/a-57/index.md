abstract: The evolution of complex life forms, exemplified by multicellular organisms,
  can be traced through a series of evolutionary transitions in individuality, beginning
  with the origin of life, followed by the emergence of the eukaryotic cell, and,
  among other transitions, culminating in the shift from unicellularity to multicellularity.
  Several attempts have been made to explain the origins of such transitions, many
  of which have been internalist (i.e., based largely on internal properties of ancestral
  entities). Here, we show how externalist perspectives can shed new light on questions
  pertaining to evolutionary transitions in individuality. We do this by presenting
  the ecological scaffolding framework in which properties of complex life forms arise
  from an external scaffold. Ultimately, we anticipate that progress will come from
  recognition of the importance of both the internalist and externalist modes of explanation.
  We illustrate this by considering an extension of the ecological scaffolding model
  in which cells modify the environment that later becomes the scaffold giving rise
  to multicellular individuality.
