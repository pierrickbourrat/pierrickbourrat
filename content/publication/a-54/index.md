abstract: Philosophers have proposed many accounts of biological function. A coarse-grained
  distinction can be made between backward-looking views, which emphasise historical
  contributions to fitness, and forward-looking views, which emphasise the current
  contribution to fitness or role of a biological component within some larger system.
  These two views are often framed as being incompatible and conflicting with one
  another. The emerging field of synthetic biology, which involves applying engineering
  principles to the design and construction of biological systems, complicates things
  further by adding intentional design as a source of function. In the current study
  we explored how biology experts and novices think about function in the context
  of single-celled, multi-celled, and synthetic organisms. We also explored the extent
  to which each group were function pluralists, and if they were function pluralists,
  which accounts of function tended to be endorsed together. The results showed a
  surprising degree of similarity between experts and novices in most contexts, although
  certain differences were apparent. Most surprisingly, we found evidence not only
  of function pluralism in both groups, but pluralism between backward-looking and
  forward-looking accounts. We discuss these findings in the context of the philosophical
  debate on function and consider the practical implications for public acceptance
  of synthetic biology. First, we argue that philosophers of biology should re-examine
  the purported incompatibility between accounts of function. Second, we argue that
  due to the introduction of an intentional aetiology in synthetic biology, there
  may be an inherent conflict between the views of experts and novices when thinking
  about synthetic biology.
