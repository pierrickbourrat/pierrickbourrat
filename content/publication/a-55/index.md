abstract: 'Evolutionary transitions in individuality are events in the history of
  life leading to the emergence of new levels of individuality. Recent studies have
  described an ecological scaffolding scenario of such transitions focused on the
  evolutionary consequences of an externally imposed renewing meta-population structure
  with limited dispersal. One difficulty for such a scenario has been explaining the
  stability of collective-level traits when scaffolding conditions no longer apply.
  Here, we show that the stability of scaffolded traits can rely on evolutionary hysteresis:
  even if the environment is reverted to an ancestral state, collectives do not return
  to ancestral phenotypes. We describe this phenomenon using a stochastic meta-population
  model and adaptive dynamics. Further, we show that ecological scaffolding may be
  limited to Goldilocks zones of the environment. We conjecture that Goldilocks zones---even
  if they might be rare---could act as initiators of evolutionary transitions and
  help to explain the near ubiquity of collective-level individuality.'
