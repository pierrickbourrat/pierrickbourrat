abstract: "The formalism used to describe evolutionary change in a multilevel setting can be
used equally to re-describe the situation as one where all the selection occurs at the
individual level. Thus, whether multilevel or individual-level selection occurs seems
to be a matter of convention rather than fact. Yet, group selection is regarded by
some as an important concept with factual rather than conventional elements. I flesh
out an alternative position that regards groups as a target of selection in a way that is
not merely definitional fiat and provide a theoretical basis for this position."
