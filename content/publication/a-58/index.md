abstract: The idea that selection can go in opposite directions or, more generally,
  be independent at different levels is well entrenched in both the biological and
  philosophical literatures. However, this idea is difficult to render precise. On
  the face of it, it seems unclear how two levels of selection could conflict with
  one another -- and thus be independent if they ultimately refer to the same Darwinian
  substrate. In this paper, I present an analysis of this problem. I argue that it
  is impossible for selection at one level to be independent from selection at a different
  level if independence is to be understood in a strong (metaphysical) sense. However,
  I propose that independence can be understood in a weaker sense, so long as our
  conception of independence does not violate the metaphysical dependence of the higher
  levels on the lower ones. From there, I argue that none of the notions of particle-level
  or collective-level selection used in the classical formal approaches to multilevel
  selection capture this weaker form of independence. Finally, I propose a different
  approach that is compatible with both metaphysical dependence and the weaker form
  of independence outlined in this paper.
