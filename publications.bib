  abstract = {The evolution of complex life forms, exemplified by multicellular organisms, can be traced through a series of evolutionary transitions in individuality, beginning with the origin of life, followed by the emergence of the eukaryotic cell, and, among other transitions, culminating in the shift from unicellularity to multicellularity. Several attempts have been made to explain the origins of such transitions, many of which have been internalist (i.e., based largely on internal properties of ancestral entities). Here, we show how externalist perspectives can shed new light on questions pertaining to evolutionary transitions in individuality. We do this by presenting the ecological scaffolding framework in which properties of complex life forms arise from an external scaffold. Ultimately, we anticipate that progress will come from recognition of the importance of both the internalist and externalist modes of explanation. We illustrate this by considering an extension of the ecological scaffolding model in which cells modify the environment that later becomes the scaffold giving rise to multicellular individuality.},

  abstract = {The idea that selection can go in opposite directions or, more generally, be independent at different levels is well entrenched in both the biological and philosophical literatures. However, this idea is difficult to render precise. On the face of it, it seems unclear how two levels of selection could conflict with one another -- and thus be independent if they ultimately refer to the same Darwinian substrate. In this paper, I present an analysis of this problem. I argue that it is impossible for selection at one level to be independent from selection at a different level if independence is to be understood in a strong (metaphysical) sense. However, I propose that independence can be understood in a weaker sense, so long as our conception of independence does not violate the metaphysical dependence of the higher levels on the lower ones. From there, I argue that none of the notions of particle-level or collective-level selection used in the classical formal approaches to multilevel selection capture this weaker form of independence. Finally, I propose a different approach that is compatible with both metaphysical dependence and the weaker form of independence outlined in this paper.},
